1. Start Instruction
    To start the game, the gem "ruby2d" is required. To install ruby2d, just simply type "gem install ruby2d" in your terminal. 
    After both ruby and ruby2d is installed, go to the set_game folder and do "ruby set_game.rb" to start playing.

2. How to play
    This is a two-player game and only mouse control is needed. 
    If player 1 finds a set, he/she should click the button 1 first, and then click the 3 cards you find. If they are a set, player 1 gets 3 point, otherwise, player 1 loses 1 points. Same goes for player 2.
    If no one can come up wit hany set, players can click shuffle button to refresh the cards on table.
    When the deck has no more card, the game will be over.
